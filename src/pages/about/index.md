### What drives us?
Besides coffee and adult beverages? Well I guess it would be the drive to learn and build. We like building things that people either react with a "why/how the hell did you do that!?" It is fun and it isn't always about the practicality or usefulness. However, with age comes wisdom and we have found that simplicity and finishing projects is a bit more important than adding an extra flamethrower or making the toaster fly.
