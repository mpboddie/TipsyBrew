### What drives us?

Besides coffee and adult beverages? Well I guess it would be the drive to learn and build. We like building things that people either react with a "why/how the hell did you do that!?" It is fun and it isn't always about the practicality or usefulness. However, with age comes wisdom and we have found that simplicity and finishing projects is a bit more important than adding an extra flamethrower or making the toaster fly.

### How can I help?

Great question! I am writing this answer now before actually publicly releasing anything, but my hope for TipsyBrew's projects are they get lots of interest by people like me. I want people to build what I am building. I want people to use part or all of a project as an inspiration for their own work. This is why I am putting it all out there. If I move too slow, continue my work the way you see fit. Is a project of mine a really close fit for you but is missing a few of you hopes and dreams? Mix it up for what you need. But most important of all, come back and share what you have done with others.

### That is great Tipsy, but I'm just waiting for you to finish XYZ!

Well, if you are following along with a project and you really need a project to speed up maybe try contributing using [Buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/XkFdpfL). If you are contributing for a specific reason, please include that information.
