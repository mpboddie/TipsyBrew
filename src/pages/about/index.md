### What drives us?

Besides coffee and adult beverages? Well I guess it would be the drive to learn and build. We like building things that people either react with a "why/how the hell did you do that!?" It is fun and it isn't always about the practicality or usefulness. However, with age comes wisdom and we have found that simplicity and finishing projects is a bit more important than adding an extra flamethrower or making the toaster fly.

### How can I help?

Great question! I am writing this answer now before actually publicly releasing anything, but my hope for TipsyBrew's projects are they get lots of interest by people like me. I want people to build what I am building. I want people to use part or all of a project as an inspiration for their own work. This is why I am putting it all out there. If I move too slow, continue my work the way you see fit. Is a project of mine a really close fit for you but is missing a few of you hopes and dreams? Mix it up for what you need. But most important of all, come back and share what you have done with others.

### That is great Tipsy, but I'm just waiting for you to finish XYZ!

Well, if you are following along with a project and you really need a project to speed up maybe try contributing using [Buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/TipsyBrew). If you are contributing for a specific reason, please include that information.

### What other ways can I show support for TipsyBrew?

That is a great question. These days there are a million different referral links and affiliate programs. I am going to list a few referral links below for services that I am currently using. No pressure but if you sign up to use a service using these links you and myself should benefit. I will try to keep them related to TipsyBrew activities.

* \***\*[**MistoBox Coffee Subscriptions**](http://mbox.coffee/RKXY) \*\***(US only), [**Trade Coffee Subscriptions**](http://s.trdcfe.me/v8jmm) (US only) - MistoBox and Trade are pretty common across my parts of the internets, but in case you have not heard of them, they partner with a ton of great roasters to get beans direct to customers. I like it because they use feedback from you to suggest beans you will like and beans ship FRESH. You are not getting beans that have been sitting on a store shelf for months. The [MistoBox referral link](http://mbox.coffee/RKXY) gets you a $10 coupon and me a $10 credit. The [Trade referral link](http://s.trdcfe.me/v8jmm) will get you your first bag free if you sign up for a subscription. **NOTE:** Trade only gets you a free bag. I don't actually benefit from it. But I already typed up why I like it, so eh, it can stay for now. Both services have an extensive selection of roasters across the country (even decent DECAF, shock!). Both ship fresh. Both are quite flexible with choice. I have used Trade longer than MistoBox, but if you are looking for a suggestion, I'd selfishly say MistoBox because they'd give me $10.
* [**Bright Cellars Wine Subscriptions**](https://www.brightcellars.com/?rn=MarkBoddie) - Bright Cellars quizzes you on your tastes and matches you with a selection of wines shipped direct to you. You are then rewarded for rating the wines and refines your picks for future shipments. I like wine, but my wife drinks it more than I do and it is very difficult to get her opinion of the wine, so I let Bright Cellars take any blame for my bad wine choices. The regular shipments are a minimum of 6 bottles but you can also adjust the frequency. With this [referral link](https://www.brightcellars.com/?rn=MarkBoddie) you get a $45 credit on your first box and I get points for their rewards program (equivalent to a free bottle for me). Aside from the regular boxes of wine, they do have offers that are not required on cases of wine, cheese, desserts, etc. I for one am a sucker for damaged label wine deals.
* [**Gemini exchange**](gemini.com/share/n7777yau9) - Ok so this is barely related, but if you'd like to get started with cryptocurrencies, signing up with Gemini and trading $100 USD in the first 30 days will get us both $10 USD.
