  For those of you in the Southern Hemisphere, TipsyBrew is very far from you
  and in peak summer.

You may have noticed a recent slowdown in TipsyBrew updates. This is (mostly) due to the dreaded summer responsibilities (_sigh_, adulting). I'm not going to sugarcoat this one bit. I love TipsyBrew and the current rig has been dutifully making me coffee on a daily basis without issue. However, this is an mostly unfunded project (except for a few cups of coffee thrown this way by my excellent supporters that visited [Buy Me A Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/TipsyBrew)). This means that when life happens, TipsyBrew progress slows.

I really didn't think that the summer slowdown was going to be as drastic as it has been, especially with the current pandemic. The pandemic for me personally has just made life busier and more hectic though. To be clear though, I am very lucky that the worst that the pandemic has done to me is make life busier. I realize that many people have been far more severely effected and that is the reason why I have been diligently wearing a mask, limiting public exposure, and keeping up platelet donations. As a scientific person, I myself do believe that any rational action that may make other people's lives easier is worth my effort. With the school year on the horizon, I am extra hopeful that a lot of small effort over large populations will at least afford our kids with some normalcy.

Back to the TipsyBrew pour over machine though! Like I said, it is running great but I'm always thinking of improvements. Although I haven't been posting new work, I have been 3D printing up a storm for some things to come. Here is a quick run through of things that will be upcoming:

* Temperature control (long time coming)
* New stand!
* Evaluating polar (current) vs cartesian brew head movements
* Additional weight sensor
* Wifi? Don't get TOO excited, but I do have the hardware
* Material and plan freeze to focus on how to guides

I could go on, but I think that is an ambitious enough list to throw out there. Questions? Comments? Did I miss something? Head to the [discord](https://discord.gg/RP9Ubb6) as always.
