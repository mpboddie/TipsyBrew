  Oh god, I just lost all software engineers that were ever stuck on a really
  bad agile team by calling this a stand up. Anyways, the TipsyBrew pour over
  machine stand... is up.

What we have here is a very basic stand to start organizing parts into one thing. Normally I don't want to document or share plans that may not be a final part of the project or have some sort of educational value. However, I realized that this would be good to demonstrate that you can build a stand with just a few basic tools.

I made this stand using a drill and circular saw... oh and an iron. Edge banding, it sucks but so does exposed particle board. The material choices I made was just some scraps I had on hand. This unfortunately resulted in it looking like Ikea made it. I have nothing against Ikea, but it doesn't really look like _good_ Ikea.

### Bill of Materials

Like I said, I tried to keep this real simple. You see above that I made it out of five pieces of wood. And although I used 2 kinds of boards, you could just as easily use just one type.

I prioritized using some Melamine boards I had because it handles moisture well. I felt like using all Melamine would make it look a little bland though, so I used the maple plywood for the sides. I treated the plywood with tung oil to help it with moisture.

### Assembly

I kept assembly pretty straight forward as well. Normally I would have went with some pocket holes for this kind of assembly, but it is a prototype stand. I just drilled pilot holes throught the ply into the edge of the melamine and turned a screw in. The base and the rear top support are both attached this way.

I toiled a little bit as to weather I wanted to mount the rear top support vertical (like it is now) or horizontally. I figure the pump is going to be mounted to this board so I was trying to consider the best orientation. I am not exactly sure vertical was the correct answer, but we will see!

The front top support piece is tilted slightly so the  display is directed at the user's face. It is also not attached to the rest of the stand. With just the base and rear top piece, the stand is rock solid. It doesn't need any more screws holding it together and I anticipate that with pump and shower head experiments, it is going to be nice having full access to the area behind the front top support. I also mounted it a little above the top of the sides. This was a complete last minute decision and wasn't necessary at all. This means I have a little more edge banding to do.

As you can see in my accidental ASMR video above (yeah that's right turn the volume up you wood on wood sickos--errr I mean no judgement here), the front top support easily slides in and out of place. It is just friction fit and uses some super simple 3d printed brackets so that it stays OCD aligned. The STL for the brackets can be [found on GitHub](https://github.com/mpboddie/TipsyBrewPourOver/blob/master/3dPrints/digitalPlatformHolder.stl). Are you guys aware of the sweet STL viewer on GitHub? It is way better than Thingiverse. If only GitHub had the content of Thingiverse.

Could I have made it fancier with a hinged or magnetic solution? Yes, of course, but that wouldn't get me a damn good cup of coffee faster, so this is what we are rolling with in Phase One.

### Arduino Bed

Another portion I anticipate being removed and replaced semi frequently is the Arduino and shields which reside on the front panel. For this reason I did not want to attach the Arduino with screws.

Roll more accidental ASMR!!! As you can see in this video, I made a 3D printed "bed" for the Arduino. This is nothing new, but I couldn't find exactly what I wanted out there already so I whipped [this design together](https://github.com/mpboddie/TipsyBrewPourOver/blob/master/3dPrints/ArduinoMount.stl). Getting the pins exactly lined up with the holes on an UNO board using digital calipers was a little nerve racking. Luckily I found [some official dimensions](https://blog.adafruit.com/2011/02/28/arduino-hole-dimensions-drawing/).

Good night everyone. I leave you with another pic of the complete stand.
