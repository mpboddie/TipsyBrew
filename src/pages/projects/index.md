  Too much! If you aren't doing too much then you aren't doing enough.
  Here at TipsyBrew we are focused on brewing though. Well actually we are
  focused on brewing technology in between actual brewing. Check out some
  of the project details below.

      title: Pour over coffee
      text: >
        Pour over coffee is extremely simple in theory, but mastering the art
        and doing it everyday can be a chore. The TipsyBrew pour over project
        aims to automate the pour over process with repeatable accuracy. Our
        approach is to document the ideas and day to day progress on the blog here,
        while commiting useful code to GitHub.

      title: Homebrewing
      text: >
        Tipsy loves beer. That shouldn't be much of a surprise. If you are unfamiliar,
        homebrewing beer is an extremely fun and addictive hobby. It is also time
        consuming and difficult to manage when life gets in the way. Truth be
        told, there are a lot of great automated solutions out there due to
        homebrewing's recent popularity. However, we may share some of the progress
        on TipsyBrew's solution.

      title: Distilling
      text: >
        Admittedly, we have zero experience with distilling... but that really
        just makes us want to look into it even more (well that and a love of whisk(e)y.
        It is going to take us a while to get to this though, so don't hold your breath.
