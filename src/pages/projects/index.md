      title: Pour over coffee
      text: >
        Pour over coffee is extremely simple in theory, but mastering the art
        and doing it everyday can be a chore. The TipsyBrew pour over project
        aims to automate the pour over process with repeatable accuracy.

        We offer a small, but carefully curated selection of brewing gear and
        tools for every taste and experience level. No matter if you roast your
        own beans or just bought your first french press, you’ll find a gadget
        to fall in love with in our shop.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
